Complete the reading of Chapter 3 and additionally read Chapter 4 section 4.1-4.2 (If you do not have a copy of the textbook yet, there is one on reserve at the library under "COMP000-STAFF - Permanent Reserve").

<b>PLEASE MARK YOUR HOMEWORK CLEARLY, REGARDLESS OF IF YOU WRITE IT OUT IN INK OR PENCIL!</b>

<ol markdown="1">
1.	(2 pts) What is a runtime error in C++?
  <div style="margin-bottom:3em"></div>

2.	(6 pts) Use precedence rules to re-write the following expressions:
  <div style="margin-bottom:1em"></div>
	(i) x / 4 - 3 == 1 && 6 * x + y > 0
  <div style="margin-bottom:2em"></div>
	(ii) a / b * b < 0.5 || --flag >= 0
  <div style="margin-bottom:2em"></div>
	(iii) z * m + n / v >= 5 && b + c - d != 0 || f < g
  <div style="margin-bottom:2em"></div>

3.	(4 pts) What is the output of the following statements?
  <div markdown="1">
```
int p = 5;
while (--p > 0)
     cout << p << " ";
```
  </div>
  <div style="margin-bottom:2em"></div>

4.	(4 pts) What is the output of the following statements?
  <div markdown="1">
```
int s = 1;
do
     cout << s << " ";
while (s++ <= 5);
```
  </div>
  <div style="margin-bottom:2em"></div>
  

5.	(4 pts) Same question as above, but the last statement now reads:

  <div markdown="1">
```
while (++s <= 5);
```
  </div>
  <div style="margin-bottom:2em"></div>
  <div class="pagebreak"></div>

6.	(10 pts) Write a function named 'check_descending' that takes three arguments of type int and returns true if the arguments are in descending order; otherwise, it returns false. You can use any type of C++ statements that we've gone over in class so far to accomplish this goal.
	<div style="margin-bottom:30em"></div>

7. (6 pts) The infinite series: s = 1 + (2/3) + (4/9) + (8/27) + .... is a geometric series that converges to a whole rational number (i.e. like 2 or 3 or 4). Below is an unfinished C++ program that will calculate s to the kth position (so, for example, if k = 1, then s = 1 + (2/3) = 1.666...). Fill in the missing code:
  <div style="margin-bottom:1em"></div>

  <div markdown="1">
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

int main(){
    double s(0.0);
    int k(0);
    cout << "Enter k: ";
    cin >> k;
    for (____________________________________________________) { 
    
        s = ____________________________________________________; }
        
    cout << "Series converges to: " << s << endl;
    return 0;
}
```
  </div>

8. (8 pts) Compile and run the above completed program. What is the value of s if k = 6? if k = 19 ? What whole rational number does s look like it's approaching? What is the smallest value of k for s to be shown by the program as exactly equal to that whole number?
