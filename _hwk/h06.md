Read Chapter 4, sections 4.1 - 4.3 (If you do not have a copy of the textbook yet, there is one on reserve at the library under "COMP000-STAFF - Permanent Reserve").
Please note that while the book does not cover number representation, it is an important concept for this class. Questions 3 to  are meant to give you more practice with number representation. These should be answered based on material presented in lectures 5 and 6.

<b>PLEASE MARK YOUR HOMEWORK CLEARLY, REGARDLESS OF IF YOU WRITE IT OUT IN INK OR PENCIL!</b>

2.	(2 pts) What is type casting and how is it performed in C++?
  <div style="margin-bottom:4em"></div>

3.	(6 pts) Convert each of the following from binary to decimal and hex, assuming an unsigned representation:

6.  (2 pts) C++ 11 offers a datatype named "uint16_t" that uses exactly 16 bits to represent any non-negative integer. What is the largest value that can be stored in the variable x, if it is declared as <code>uint16_t x;</code> 
<div style="margin-bottom:2em"></div>


7.	(2 pts) In C++, how would you generate a random number between 5 and 15?
  <div style="margin-bottom:4em"></div>
  
8.	(4 pts) List at least 8 pre-defined functions in C++ that come from the cmath library.
  <div style="margin-bottom:5em"></div>

9.	(6 pts) Write out a short program that simulates the tossing of 2 dice. When run, the program will print out 2 numbers representing 2 randomly thrown dice and then quits. Are the 2 numbers always different every time the program is run?
  <div style="margin-bottom:12em"></div>
