<b>Reading: {{page.desc}},  {{page.reading}}</b>
 
<ol start="1">

<li>(10 pts) Fill in the information in the header. The following are required to get the 10 "participation" points.
    <ul>
    <li>Filling in your name and umail address.<br /></li>
    <li>WRITING (not circling!) either 11, 12, 1, or 2, to indicate your discussion section (lab) meeeting time.<br /></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Also: For paper submission PLEASE submit on ONE SHEET OF PAPER, double-sided if at all possible. If you must submit  on two printed sheets write name on BOTH sheets and no staples, paperclips, or folded corners.<br />

 <li>The history of Unix as an OS (and then, the history of all Operating Systems, including those derived from Unix, such as Linux, Mac OS X, etc.) was heavily influenced by the choice of programming language in which Unix was first implemented. 
  <ol type='a'>
    <li style='margin-bottom:2em;'>(2 pts) What programming language was chosen for the first implementation of Unix?.</li>
    
    <li style='margin-bottom:2em;'>(2 pts) Most other OS implementations, up to that point in time, had been written in what language?</li>
    
    <li style='margin-bottom:2em;'>(2 pts) According to the authors, as a direct result of these two facts (your answers to (a) and (b)), Unix had a distinct advantage over other OSes. What was this advantage?</li>
  </ol>
  </li>

 <li>The "machine cycle" is a core concept in  computing. There are three steps in this cycle. Each is labelled with the first letter of the step. Briefly describe each step. (We didn't cover this in class, so you will have to read and search!) 
  <ol type='a'>
    <li style='margin-bottom:2em;'>(3 pts) f:</li>
    
    <li style='margin-bottom:2em;'>(3 pts) d:</li>
    
    <li  style='margin-bottom:2em;'>(3 pts) e:</li>
  </ol>
  </li>

 <div class="pagebreak"></div>

<li>(4 pts style='margin-bottom:1em;') A process is a _____________________________ that is _____________________________.</li>

  <li>The ps command and the jobs command both list processes. Write a few words that distinguishes between the ways that they are used, that is:
  <ol>
    <li style='margin-bottom:2em;'>(4 pts) What do you type to suspend the current running program?</li>
    
    <li style='margin-bottom:3em;'>(4 pts) What do you type to resume the suspended program?</li>
  </ol>
  </li>
  
  
  <li>You have just built and run an executable using bash (or any shell). Briefly describe these conceps as they apply to running your program. But be specific enough that the grader has NO DOUBT that you have read, listened, and understood. 
  <ol>
    <li style='margin-bottom:5em;'>(3 pts) fork</li>
    
    <li style='margin-bottom:5em;'>(3 pts) exec</li>
    
    <li style='margin-bottom:5em;'>(3 pts) parent</li>

    <li style='margin-bottom:5em;'>(3 pts) child</li>
</ol>
  </li>

  <li>You have just built an executable using bash (or any shell). You run it with the command <code>./myGreatExe</code>. "Under the hood", something called "fork" and "exec" are used, and there is some sort of "parent" and "child" relation. Briefly describe these. But be specific enough that the grader has NO DOUBT that you have read, listened, and understood. 
  <ol>
    <li style='margin-bottom:2em;'>(3 pts) What is a circumstance where ps is more appropriate than jobs?</li>
    
    <li style='margin-bottom:6em;'>(3 pts) What is a circumstance where jobs is more appropriate than ps?</li>
    
</ol>
