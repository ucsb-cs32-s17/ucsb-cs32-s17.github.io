 <li>The history of Unix as an OS (and then, the history of all Operating Systems, including those derived from Unix, such as Linux, Mac OS X, etc.) was heavily influenced by the choice of programming language in which Unix was first implemented. 
  <ol type='a'>
    <li style='margin-bottom:2em;'>(2 pts) What programming language was chosen for the first implementation of Unix?.</li>
    
    <li style='margin-bottom:6em;'>(2 pts) Most other OS implementations, up to that point in time, had been written in what language?</li>
    
    <li>(2 pts) According to the authors, as a direct result of these two facts (your answers to (a) and (b)), Unix had a distinct advantage over other OSes. What was this advantage?</li>
  </ol>
  </li>

 <li>The "machine cycle" (also called the "instruction cycle") is a core concept in understanding computing. In the description of this cycle in the Reader, the three steps start with the letters "f", "d", and "e". Please briefly describe what each of these steps means. Each is labelled with the first letter of the step. (We didn't cover this in class, so you will have to read and search!) 
  <ol type='a'>
    <li style='margin-bottom:2em;'>(3 pts) f:</li>
    
    <li style='margin-bottom:6em;'>(3 pts) d:</li>
    
    <li>(3 pts) e:</li>
  </ol>

  <li style='margin-bottom:6em;'>(4 pts) Fill in the blanks. <br />
  A process is a _________________________________ that is __________________________________.

  <li>The ps command and the jobs command both list processes. Write a few words that distinguishes between the ways that they are used, that is:
  <ol>
    <li style='margin-bottom:4em;'>(4 pts) What do you type to suspend the current running program?</li>
    
    <li style='margin-bottom:8em;'>(4 pts) What do you type to resume the suspended program?</li>
  </ol>
  </li>
  
  
  
  


  <li>You have just built an executable using bash (or any shell). You run it with the command <code>./myGreatExe</code>. "Under the hood", something called "fork" and "exec" are used, and there is some sort of "parent" and "child" relation. Briefly describe these. But be specific enough that the grader has NO DOUBT that you have read, listened, and understood.
