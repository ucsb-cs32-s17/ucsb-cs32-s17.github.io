<!--Tag: Operator Precedence -->
1.	(6 pts) Precedence rules determine how the compiler groups operators and operands when evaluating an expression in the absence of paranthesis. For each of the following expressions add paranthesis to show how the expression is evaluated according to the C++ precedence rules?

<div markdown="1">
```
  a) x == 2 || y > 20 

  b) !y && x < 9 * 2 || y < x

  c) x + 7 > 10 || x + 23 < -7
```
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom:2em"></div>

2.	(2 pts) Show the output of the following code AND also write the final value of x after the code is executed.
<div markdown="1">
```
int x = 17;
while ( x > 0) {
   cout << x << endl;
   x = x â€“ 5;
 }
```
</div> 
<div style="margin-bottom:2em"></div>

3.	(2 pts) What is the outcome of the following code?
<div markdown="1">
```
int x = 0;
while ( x = 2 && x <10) {
   cout << x << endl;
   x+=2;
 }
```
</div>

<!--Tag: Boolean expressions -->
5.  (6 pts)  What is the result (i.e. TRUE or FALSE) of the following Boolean expressions in C++, given that: x = 2, y = -1, z = 0 in each case
  <div style="margin-bottom:0em"></div>
<div markdown="1">
```
  a) (x == 6)
  b) !(y > 0)
  c) ((x == 2) || (y > 20))
  d) ((x >= 3) && (z <= 12)) 
  e) ((x > y) && (y < z))
  f) ((!(x < z) || (y > z)) && (z == 12) && (y == 10))
  
```
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom:2em"></div>


<!--Tag: plain, nested  and multiway if-else -->

6.	(9 pts) Using plain and/or multiway if-else statements ONLY write a program that outputs the grade of a student given an integer variable 'score'. The program should read the student's score from standard input. If the score is outside the range of 0 and 100, the program should output "Not a valid score" and exit. Otherwise it should output the string "Grade is X" where X is replaced by the student's letter grade according to the following rubric: 
<div markdown="1">
```
90 <= score <=100, grade = 'A'| 80 <= score < 90 , grade = 'B'| 70 <= score < 80 , grade = 'C'| 
60 <= score < 70 , grade = 'D' | 0 <= score < 60 , grade = 'F'
```
<div style="margin-bottom:1em"></div>
<div style="margin-bottom:0em"></div>
.....a) Make your program easy to read and understand. Format your answers so that they are readable on the display. This means consider your use of "\n" characters.
<div style="margin-bottom:0em"></div>
.....b) Test this program out by compiling it and running it the same way you do with lab assignments. When you are sure that you have a working program, write it out in the space provided below. You will be graded for programming style as well as having a functionally correct program.
