# Syllabus <a name="syllabus"></a>

<p>Welcome to Computer Science 32: Object-Oriented Programming</p>

<p>This document and others linked within it should be your PRIMARY source for understanding the expectations of this course. Be sure to read it *carefully*.</p>
<p>You must contact the instructor for clarification if you receive information from any another source that is in contradiction to what is provided below.</p>

<p>We are basically picking up in the CS16 and CS24 books where they were left off after those courses... more or less.</p>
<p>The outline and content of the class come from Michael Costanzo's experience teaching the class. We are going to try to do something that software engineers don't like to do: use somebody else's software.</p>
<p>One of our TAs has TAed this class before and that experience will help us out.</p>
<p>There are two parallel threads in the class: OOP/C++ is one of them, and the other is Operating Systems/Linux. The labs and lectures will cover both of these aspects of software development</p>

## Required Resources

<ul>
   <li>The newest editions of the textbook are preferred. Earlier editions are reasonable substitutes, but students then must be responsible for translating any page-specific assignments and other details.</li>
   <li>The Computer Science 32 Reader is required course reading along with the two textbooks used in CS 16 and CS 24. Get the Reader from SBPrinter in the UCEN. Note there are no substantive changes in the reader since Fall 2011, so any version since then is okay too.</li>

## Exam Resources

You can find examples of previous quarter's  exams at the following links.

* http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~pconrad/cs16/14F/exams/

But BEWARE---offerings of CS16 may vary in terms of their exact pace, and placement of exams. So these exams are a guide to the style of my exams, but NOT necessarily for specific content.

In addition, these exams from prior to F14 used the C programming language rather than C++, and went at a much slower pace, so treat them with even more skepticism.
