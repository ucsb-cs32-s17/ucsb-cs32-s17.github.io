<p class="fine-print">Clarification: The question is asking about
"non-static inner classes".<br>  <b>If you don't know what that means, that's
fine</b>: we didn't really talk about static vs. non-static inner classes.
<br><b>Just answer the question from the standpoint of "inner classes" as
discussed in the HFJ textbook, and in lecture.</b> <br>If you know what
"static inner classes" are, then answer the question about
"non-static" inner classes.</p>

<li markdown="1"> (10 pts) From a "big picture" standpoint, what is the role of *design patterns* in object oriented software development?

<li class="page-break-before" markdown="1" style="margin-bottom:1em;"> (10 pts) This problem and several that follow will make to the following handouts.
Please refer to them while answering these problems.

* p. 1 of [Handout A](handout_a/){:data-ajax="false} which has several reminders about `Comparable`, `Comparator`, etc.
* p. 1 of [Handout B](handout_b/){:data-ajax="false} which has incomplete code for a `Student` class.

Consider the following class that uses `Student`, called `StudentSort`.


<style>
 figure.highlight { margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;}
</style>

{% highlight java linenos %}
// StudentSort.java
import java.util.ArrayList;

class StudentSort {
    
    public static void main(String [] args) {
	ArrayList<Student> roster = new ArrayList<Student>();
	roster.add(new Student(6234567,"Bob",3.25,"CMPSC"));
	roster.add(new Student(7152353,"Charlie",3.96,"CMPSC"));
	roster.add(new Student(2352353,"Alice",3.97,"CMPEN"));
	roster.add(new Student(2888888,"Danielle",4.00,"CMPSC"));
	roster.add(new Student(1152353,"Ed",2.90,"CMPEN"));

	java.util.Collections.sort(roster);
	
	for (Student s: roster) {
	    System.out.println(s);
	}	
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

Suppose we want line 14 of this code, `java.util.Collections.sort(roster);` to sort in lexicographic order by name (Alice, Bob, Charlie, Danielle, Ed).   In order for this code to work properly, and indeed for the `Student.java` class to even compile, at least one extra method must be added.   

Please write the additional method that would be added Student.java in the space below. \\
Please try to avoid writing too close to the end of the page (it doesn't scan well.)

</li>

<li markdown="1" class="page-break-before"> (10 pts) Please continue to refer to:

* The `StudentSort.java` file on p. 2 of the exam.
* p. 1 of [Handout A](handout_a/){:data-ajax="false} 
* p. 1 of [Handout B](handout_b/){:data-ajax="false} 

Assume that you've added the necessary method from the previous problem so that Student.java now compiles, and
line 14 will sort the `ArrayList<Student>` in the correct order.

Below, you see some two examples of output.  The output on the left is
what we got, but the output on the right is what we want.

Student(2888888,"Danielle",4.00,CMPSC)
Student(1152353,"Ed",2.90,CMPEN)
```
</td>

</table>

Below please write the additional code that would need to be added to `Student.java` to make this change. \\
As always, please avoid writing too close to the edge of the page.



</li>

<li markdown="1" class="page-break-before"> (10 pts) Please continue to refer to:

* The `StudentSort.java` file on p. 2 of the exam.
* p. 1 of [Handout A](handout_a/){:data-ajax="false} 
* p. 1 of [Handout B](handout_b/){:data-ajax="false} 

Consider the following Java code that also makes use of the `Student` class.   As you can see, in order for this code to compile,
four additional methods would have to be added to the `Student` class, namely the ones invoked on lines 16,17,18 and 19.

On p. 2 of [Handout A](handout_a/){:data-ajax="false}, you will see the output of various invocations of this program (assuming the necessary change are made to the code, including the methods you added Student.java in questions 4 and 5, and the implementations of these four additional methods.

For this question, we focus ONLY on the method `sortByName` invoked on line 16.  

{% highlight java linenos %}
// StudentMain.java
import java.util.ArrayList;

class StudentMain {
    
    public static void main(String [] args) {
	ArrayList<Student> roster = new ArrayList<Student>();
	roster.add(new Student(6234567,"Bob",3.25,"CMPSC"));
	roster.add(new Student(7152353,"Charlie",3.96,"CMPSC"));
	roster.add(new Student(2352353,"Alice",3.97,"CMPEN"));
	roster.add(new Student(2888888,"Danielle",4.00,"CMPSC"));
	roster.add(new Student(1152353,"Ed",2.90,"CMPEN"));
	
	if (args.length > 0 ) {
	    switch (args[0]) {
	    case "name":      Student.sortByName(roster); break;
	    case "majorName": Student.sortByMajorThenName(roster); break;
	    case "gpaDesc":   Student.sortByGPADesc(roster); break;
	    case "perm":      Student.sortByPerm(roster); break;
	    default: break;
	    }
	}
	
	for (Student s: roster) {
	    System.out.println(s);
	}	
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

In the space below, please write an implementation of `sortByName` that sorts the roster by name as indicated
on p. 2 of [Handout A](handout_a/).

*For full credit*: please write the body of this method as a single line of code.\\
*Specifically*: use a line of code that takes advantage of the fact that `Student` implements `Comparable<Student>`.

For half-credit, you may use any technique that sorts the array correctly.


</li>


<li markdown="1" class="page-break-before"> (10 pts) Please continue to refer to:

* The `StudentSort.java` file on p. 2 of the exam.
* p. 1 and p. 2 of [Handout A](handout_a/){:data-ajax="false} 
* p. 1 of [Handout B](handout_b/){:data-ajax="false} 

Now, please write the code for the `sortByMajorThenName` method invoked on line 17 of `StudentMain.java`.

*For Full Credit* the body of your method should use the `sort` method
of java.util.ArrayList, passing in an object that implements `Comparator<ArrayList>` that is

* EITHER an instance of an anonymous class 
* OR an instance of an inner class of `Student`.  

If you choose the inner class technique, include the definition of the inner class in your answer.

For half credit: use any technique that will sort the array correctly.

</li>

<li markdown="1" class="page-break-before"> (10 pts) Please continue to refer to:

* The `StudentSort.java` file on p. 2 of the exam.
* p. 1 and p. 2 of [Handout A](handout_a/){:data-ajax="false} 
* p. 1 of [Handout B](handout_b/){:data-ajax="false} 

Now, please write the code for the `sortByPerm` method invoked on line 19 of `StudentMain.java`.

<b>For Full Credit</b> you MUST use a <b>lambda expression</b>.

That is, the body of your method should use the `sort` method
of `java.util.ArrayList`, passing in an object that implements
`Comparator<ArrayList>` in the form of a **lambda expression**.

As a reminder, the general syntax of a Java lambda expression is as follows:

| parameters | syntax                  |
|------------|-------------------------|
|  `x`       | `(x)   -> return_value` |
|  `x,y`     | `(x,y) -> return_value` |
|  <em> etc... <em> |                        |

For half credit: use any technique that will sort the array correctly (e.g. inner class, anonymous class).   If you use
an inner class, be sure to include the definition of that inner class in your answer.

<li markdown="1" class="page-break-before"> (10 pts) Please continue to refer to:

* The `StudentSort.java` file on p. 2 of the exam.
* p. 1 and p. 2 of [Handout A](handout_a/){:data-ajax="false} 
* p. 1 of [Handout B](handout_b/){:data-ajax="false} 

Now, finally please write the code for the `sortByGPADesc` method invoked on line 18 of `StudentMain.java`.

Take note of two things:
* The fact that we want the order to be descending, not ascending
* The fact that we are using `double` not int.  
* The `java.lang.Math.signum` function described on p. 1 of [Handout A](handout_a/){:data-ajax="false}.

<b>For Full Credit</b> the body of your method should use the `sort`
method of `java.util.ArrayList`, passing in an object that implements
`Comparator<ArrayList>`.

However, that object can be created using any reasonable technique, at your discretion, i.e. any of the following:

* anonymous class
* inner class
* lambda expression

<li class="page-break-before" style="margin-bottom:10em;"> (4 pts) Briefly, at a "big picture" level, what was the task you were given to do in lab05, the parsing assignment?

If you aren't sure what I'm asking for in this question, perhaps this will help.   You were given a working piece of code that did one thing, and you were asked to transform it into a working piece of code that did the same thing, plus something extra.

What was the thing it did before your changes, and what was the extra part you added?

<li style="margin-bottom:16em;"> Again, at the "big picture" level, briefly describe each of the following, with <em>specific examples</em>&mdash;specific enough that there is no doubt in the grader's mind that you know what you are talking about, but not a lengthy essay.
