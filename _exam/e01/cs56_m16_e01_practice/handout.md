<h2>INSTRUCTIONS FOR QUESTION 1</h2>

<p>Write the code for the <code>IndexEntry</code> class, per the instructions below.</p>

<div style="padding:1em; margin:1em; float:right; width:33%; font-family: Times New Roman, serif; border: 1px solid black;">
...<br>
BoxLayout manager 411<br>
brain barbell 33<br>
break statement 105<br>
BufferedReader 454<br>
BufferedWriter 453<br>
buffers 453<br>
byte 51<br>
bytecode 2<br>
...<br>
</div>
<p>Books such as textbooks have an index in the back to help you find
topics easily.   Consider, for example, a fragment of the index of our
CS56 textbook shown in the box at right.  Each of these entries shows
only one string (a topic) and then an integer which is the page on
which that topic appears.  For simplicity, assume for now that a topic
appears on one and only one page (that is not true in practice, but
for now, assume that it is.)</p>

<p>You will write a Java class to represent one entry in this index.
For full credit, your class should have all of the following. Go over
this as a &quot;checklist&quot; when you are finished to make sure you
have everything needed.</p>

<p> Note that for <strong>this</strong> exam, you do NOT need to include Javadoc comments.</p>

   <ol>
     <li>(10 pts) Correct syntax and structure of a Java class.<br>
       <br>
     </li>
     <li>(8 pts) Private instance variables for the data members (attributes).<br>
       <br>
</li>
     <li>
       (8 pts) A two-argument constructor that takes arguments for the topic and the page number<br>

       Example invocation: <code>IndexEntry ie = new IndexEntry("BoxLayout Manager",411);</code><br><br />
     </li>
     <li>
       (8 pts) getter methods called <code>getTopic</code> and <code>getPage</code>. <br>
         <br>
     </li>
     <li>
       (8 pts) setter methods called <code>setTopic</code> and <code>setPage</code>. <br>
         <br>
     </li>
     <li>
       (8 pts) a correct <code>toString()</code> method.  The method should return the topic followed by the page number, separated by a single space.
            <br>
         <br>
     </li>
   </ol><!-- items for programming question -->

<p>NOTE: You do NOT need to implement an equals() method for this exam.  We'll cover that topic on midterm 2.</p>
