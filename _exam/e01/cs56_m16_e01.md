(10 pts) B.C. Dull thinks that unchecked exceptions are a bad idea.  B.C. 
suggests that Java would be better language if all exceptions were
checked exceptions.

Explain why B.C. Dull is incorrect.   

*For full credit:* Be precise, but concise: 
include enough detail so the grader does not have to guess whether you
understand the difference between checked and unchecked exceptions, but
DO NOT include detail that is not relevant to the question being asked.

<li markdown="1" class="page-break-before" style="margin-bottom:20em;">
(10 pts) We are using the `ant` utility in this course, which works with a file called `build.xml`

If you were asked at a job interview to briefly describe the purpose of `ant`, and the 
type of information contained in a `build.xml`, what would you say?    

Include enough detail
in your answer so that the interview knows that you are technically sharp, and  they should hire you.  

Do not include so much extra detail that the interviewer finds you tedious and annoying, and decides you would be  painful to work with, and chooses to not hire you.

(10 pts) In lecture, we discussed the way that that Java compiler (or any 
compiler, for that matter) deals with the problem of turning Java code
into bytecodes that can be interpreted by the Java Virtual Machine.

We discussed that the first phase is often to turn a sequence of 
characters into a sequence of *tokens*.

Here is some Java code.   List what the first twelve tokens
in this code would be by filling in the blanks.

```java


while (a >= 1) {
    a = a / 2;
    System.out.println("in loop");	
}
```

(10 pts) On the [handout](handout) there is some code.    Your job: figure out after which line of main() each of the following objects is eligible for garbage collection. 

If an object is still not eligible for garbage collection when the last line of main is reached, write "never".    Your answer should be one of the line numbers that appears in comments in main (e.g. `/* 3 */` or `/* 7 */`) or the word "never".
