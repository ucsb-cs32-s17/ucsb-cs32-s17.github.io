## Instructions for the exam (please note that instructions for miderm 2 are different from midterm 1)

* You may NOT bring any notes with you to the exam. Instead we ask that you collaborate with your classmates and the tutors before the exam to develop a commmon set of notes via an online collaborative document
* Creating the collaborative notes document: Please add information that you would like to have on the exam to this [COLLABORATIVE DOCUMENT](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ctpQAlAiTz5L8m8m9ibGlQG9Jcir4xmIUFiknvRR0wk/edit?usp=sharing). A subset of the information will be made available to you on the exam as exam notes.
* I will select information from the above collaborative document as notes and provide it to you on the exam. These notes will NOT include solutions to programming assignments from labs or HWs. Everyone will get the same set of notes on the exam.  
* No calculators or phones are allowed in the exam 
* You may not bring ANY notes or books 
* There are no makeups for this exam 
* You must write your name on every single sheet of paper including your notes
* We will provide you with scratch paper
* We will provide you the table of operator precedence
* The format of the exam will be similar to midterm 1

* You will be provided with the these [exam notes]( 
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1reYOFGbQjos9PJIIVppPSorxpzcMSS9YfdP9MNWnesI/edit?usp=sharing
 )

## Reference material
You are expected to know the material from the following lectures, labs and homeworks. Please be sure to review the code from lecture which can be found in the lecture notes (different from lecture slides)

* [Lecture 1](https://ucsb-cs16-wi17.github.io/lectures/lect01/) (2017-01-10) to [lecture 14](https://ucsb-cs16-wi17.github.io/lectures/lect14/) (2017-02-28), with the exception of file IO, operator precedence (lectures 4 and 5), makefiles and tdd. You will be tested on these topics on the final exam. The main emphasis will be on topics covered after midterm 1 ([lecture 8](https://ucsb-cs16-wi17.github.io/lectures/lect08/) to [lecture 14](https://ucsb-cs16-wi17.github.io/lectures/lect14/)), with the exception of makefiles and tdd. In other words, you will be primarily tested on pointers, references, arrays, structs, pointers to basic or struct type, and linked lists. A full list is provided later in this document.
* Homeworks 1 to 11, with emphasis on homeworks 7 to 11
* Labs 3 to 6 


* Pracice problem: Please go through the problems in our [Concept Inventory](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B1z9k2M7uTvJaE9rR0F0OVV5ZWs?usp=sharing) for additional preparation. We recommend that you try these problems after you have studied/contributed to the collaborative notes (see above) and gone through the labs, homeworks and lectures.

## Past exams
You may also refer to all the past exams. Please note that some questions on these exams may refer to labs that you have not completed so far. You will only be asked questions related to the labs you have completed. The past exams should however provide some information on the expected difficulty and approximate format of the exam. Please note that there may be differences in content as well.
