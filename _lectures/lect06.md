# Topics

## Data represnentations contd.

* Conversion between different representations
* Key ideas: bits can represent ANYTHING. With n bits we can represent at most 2^N things
* Apply above rule to represent characters (ASCII), unicode, colors ....
* What is signed vs unsigned integer representation
* Signed representation used by moderm computers: two's complement
* The data type of a variable determines its representation in memory AND the number of bits used to store each variable
