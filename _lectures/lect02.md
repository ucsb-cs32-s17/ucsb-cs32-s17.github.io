# Topics

## Github intro
* What is github? How and why we plan to use it in this class
* What is a git repo?
* Creating a github repo and using github's web interface to store your first program
* Gentle intro to github command line: cloning a repo to a local machine, syncing repos with git add, commit and push

## C++ variables and datatypes
* Unlike Python, you MUST "declare" variables on first appearance in any C++ program. We'll discuss what this means.
* Scope and lifetime of variables
* Uninitialized variables in C++
* We will look at three specific datatypes: char, int and string

## Simple flow control structures
* If else statements are DIFFERENT in C++ than in Python. We'll discuss.
* For and while loops are DIFFERENT in C++ than in Python. We'll discuss.






We will learn all the above concepts by writing, compiling and executing an example program in C++
