# Topics

## Code from lecture
[https://github.com/ucsb-cs16-wi17/lecture-02-09](https://github.com/ucsb-cs16-wi17/lecture-02-09)

## Pointers
* Pointer declaration - difference/similarities with declaring basic types
* Accessing variables "indirectly" via pointers
* The address and indirection operators: "&" and "*"
* Pointers and arrays - similarities and dfferences
* Passing arrays to functions - specifically looking at how arrays degnerate to pointers on function calls.


## Under the hood of function calls
* Function calls use the run-time stack, we'll see how and why that's important
* Review of pass by value
* Passing parameters to functions by value
