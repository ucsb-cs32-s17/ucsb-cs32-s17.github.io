# Notes
I will be away on 03-09, so there will be no lecture.
Instead you are asked to watch  videos 1 through 6 on C-strings by my colleague Michelle Craig:

[Click here to watch the video on C Strings](https://c-programming.onlinelearning.utoronto.ca/Strings_and_Files.shtml)

The videos talk about C-strings in the context of C instead of C++. While the discussion on C-strings applies to both languages, one key difference is that printing to standard output is different in C vs C++. In the videos, wherever you see "printf" read "cout" to get the equivalent code in C++.
