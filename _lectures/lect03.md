# Code from lecture
[https://github.com/ucsb-cs16-wi17/lecture-01-17](https://github.com/ucsb-cs16-wi17/lecture-01-17)

# Topics
* Nested and multi-way if-else 
* For, while and do-while loops - Discussion on when to use each
* Nested loops (self-learn)  
* Passing parameters to programs/main()
* We will practice both these concepts by playing and coding a game called "Fizzbuzz" in class
